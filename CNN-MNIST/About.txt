This code was developed by our team for a graded assignment in the core course on Deep Learning and Neural Networks.

This CNN model consists of 3 convolutional blocks and 2 fully connected layers.

Block 1:
-    First convolution block: Conv2d -> ReLU -> BatchNorm2d -> MaxPool
  -    Convolution Layer: 2D Convolutional Layer
    -    Input Channels: 1 (grayscale for MNIST)
    -    Number of filters: 16
    -    Kernel size: 3x3
    -    Padding: 1
    -    Stride: 1
  -    Activation Function: ReLU
  -    Batch Normalisation: BatchNorm2d
  -    Max Pooling: Stride = 2
-    Output size:
-    After convolution: ((28 - 3 + 2*1)/1) + 1 = 28
-    After pooling: 28 / 2 = 14
