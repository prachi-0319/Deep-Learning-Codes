My team and I developed this code as part of our mandatory semester project during the sixth semester of our Bachelor of Technology degree.

Plants play a crucial role in supplying food globally. Various environmental factors lead to plant diseases which results in significant production losses. However, manually identifying plant diseases takes a lot of effort and is prone to errors being made. It may not always be an accurate way to identify and prevent the spread of plant diseases. 
Agriculture is the major occupation in India, and it loses 35% of the crop productivity annually owing to plant diseases. Earlier plant disease detection is a tedious process because of improper laboratory facilities and expert knowledge. In this project, we are developing a smartphone-based Android application to help farmers and gardeners detect plant diseases automatically. By using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, which are trained on a large collection of plant disease images, our app will be able to identify various plant diseases with high accuracy. The process is simple: users can take a photo of a diseased plant with their smartphone, and the app will analyse the image to diagnose the disease. This early detection system will enable users to take prompt action to treat the plants, improving overall crop health and productivity. Through this project, our aim is to make plant disease detection easy and accessible, leveraging technology to support agriculture and gardening communities.

This project will be able to answer the following key questions:
1)  How can farmers quickly identify/diagnose plant diseases in the field without any help?
2)  Can plant diseases be accurately detected by clicking pictures on smartphones?
3)  How successful/effective is the smartphone-based detection technique compared to traditional methods? What are the limitations?

With the widespread use of smartphones and cutting-edge machine learning technology, this solution aims to democratize plant disease detection, ensuring that farmers have the tools they need to protect their crops, enhance productivity, and secure their livelihoods. The development and deployment of such a system addresses a critical need in agriculture, paving the way for more sustainable and resilient farming practices.
We followed a methodological procedure for building a deep learning model which can accurately detect diseases a plant is affected by by analysing its leaves. Our dataset, PlantVillage, is a collection of high-resolution images of 10 plant diseases that usually affect the tomato plant. Each disease has 1000â€“3000 diseased leaf images, along with a folder of healthy tomato plant leaf pictures. All these were fed to our deep learning model for training.     
In our research, we primarily utilized a subset of the PlantPAD dataset, which provided high- resolution images. This high-quality data significantly contributed to improved training and generalization of our CNN + self-attention architecture. Consequently, this approach not only enhanced our overall results but also facilitated better explainability through heatmaps, effectively highlighting the diseased areas in the images.
